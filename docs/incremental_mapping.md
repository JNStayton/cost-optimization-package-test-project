Model 1: Candidate Detection (fct_snowflake__incremental_materialization_candidates)
Entry Criteria (must meet at least one)
#	Criterion	Threshold	Signal Source
E.1	Max build time exceeds threshold	max_build_time_sec >= 300	Build history from query_history
E.2	Table size exceeds threshold	table_size_gb >= 2	int_snowflake__table_inventory
E.3	Compute waste score exceeds threshold (with min build time)	compute_waste_score >= 5 AND avg_build_time_sec >= 30	Derived: size_gb * builds_per_day
Recommendation Tiers
#	Tier	Condition	Meaning	Action
T.1	Strong Candidate	rebuild_redundancy_rate >= 0.90 with reliable signal	90%+ of each rebuild is redundant	High-confidence conversion target
T.2	Candidate	rebuild_redundancy_rate in [0.70, 0.90) with reliable signal	Meaningful redundancy exists	Good conversion target
T.3	Candidate -- Moderate Redundancy	rebuild_redundancy_rate in [0.50, 0.70)	Some overhead but growth is significant	Verify growth pattern first
T.4	Low ROI -- Minimal Rebuild Redundancy	rebuild_redundancy_rate < 0.50	Table grows too quickly	Incremental won't save meaningfully; excluded from Model 2
T.5	Candidate -- Verify Growth Signal	Row count decreased mid-lookback	Possible full-refresh or upstream deletes	Investigate before converting
T.6	Candidate -- Insufficient History	Fewer than min_qualified_build_days CTAS runs	Not enough data to trust the signal	Wait for more build history
Model 2: Strategy Selection (fct_snowflake__incremental_config_recommendations)
Strategy Decision Tree (priority order, first match wins)
#	Condition	Strategy	DDL/Config	Rationale
S.1	has_external_deletes AND has_filter_column	delete+insert	unique_key + incremental_predicates	Scopes deletes to filter window; handles upstream delete propagation
S.2	has_external_deletes AND NOT has_filter_column	merge	unique_key required	No time boundary; merge is only safe option for delete handling
S.3	has_unique_key AND has_filter_column AND is_large_table	delete+insert	unique_key + where filter_col > max(filter_col)	Avoids full-target merge scan at large scale
S.4	has_unique_key AND has_filter_column AND NOT is_large_table	merge	unique_key + where filter_col > max(filter_col)	Standard default; merge cost acceptable at moderate scale
S.5	has_filter_column AND NOT has_external_dml AND is_large_table	microbatch	event_time + batch_size	Self-healing time batches; best for reliability at scale
S.6	has_filter_column AND NOT has_external_dml	append	where filter_col > max(filter_col)	Simplest and cheapest; source is truly append-only
S.7	has_filter_column (external DML, no key)	append	where filter_col > max(filter_col)	Safe default when key isn't available
S.8	has_unique_key AND NOT has_filter_column	merge	unique_key only	No time boundary; merge required
S.9	None of the above	append	No filter, no key	Safest default; flags key identification as next step
Post-Hook: Unique Key Verification (probe_unique_key_candidates)
#	Probe Result	Action	Output
P.1	Column confirmed (APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT >= 95% of rows)	Keep strategy as-is	identified_unique_key populated, dbt_model_config references confirmed key
P.2	No single-column key confirmed AND strategy was merge/delete+insert	Downgrade to append	Strategy overwritten; strategy_notes explains surrogate key path
P.3	No single-column key confirmed AND strategy was already append	No change	Key identification flagged as TODO in config template
Coverage Assessment
What's well-covered (high confidence)
Area	Status	Notes
Rebuild redundancy detection	Strong	First/last CTAS row comparison is reliable for table-materialized models
Strategy selection matrix	Strong	All 5 Snowflake strategies covered with clear priority order
Filter column detection	Strong	Comprehensive pattern matching with ranked priority
Unique key detection + verification	Strong	Naming convention + cardinality probe + safe downgrade
Config template generation	Strong	Copy-pasteable with all parameters pre-filled
Large table branching (merge vs delete+insert)	Strong	Size-aware, correct threshold logic
What could be refined/tightened
Area	Current State	Refinement Opportunity
Redundancy rate calculation	Uses first/last CTAS rows_inserted	Could use median or percentile to be more robust against outlier runs (one unusually small run skews the rate)
"Strong Candidate" labeling passthrough	Tier name still appears in some recommendation contexts	Already fixed in gold layer — config rec reason now shows redundancy % directly
Microbatch recommendation	Only triggers for large + no DML + filter column	Could be recommended more broadly — microbatch is safer than append for any event-time data regardless of size (self-healing property)
Delete detection	Uses delete_count > 0 from query_history	Could distinguish between scheduled full-refresh deletes (dbt's own DELETE before CTAS) and true external deletes. Currently may false-positive on full-refresh patterns.
Unique key probe downgrade messaging	strategy_notes explains two paths	Could be more prescriptive — if table has a natural grain visible in column combinations, suggest the specific surrogate key columns
insert_overwrite strategy	Listed in docs but never recommended	Not implemented in the decision tree — should be added for tables with confirmed clustering keys and clean partition boundaries
Gaps in coverage
Gap	Impact	Difficulty to Implement
Late-arriving data detection	High — append/microbatch strategies silently miss late records. If late data is common, merge with lookback window is needed.	Medium — would need to track max(filter_col) over time and detect if older records appear after expected completion
Source mutation pattern classification	Medium — knowing if upstream is CDC, full-load, or append-only would inform strategy confidence	High — requires understanding the upstream source (EL tool config, source freshness patterns)
Post-conversion validation	Medium — no feedback loop to confirm the recommendation worked	Medium — could compare build time and credits before/after conversion (requires tracking the event)
Multi-column key detection	Medium — fact tables often need composite keys that naming conventions don't catch	Medium — could analyze GROUP BY patterns in downstream queries to infer grain
Partition-aligned insert_overwrite	Low-Medium — useful for date-partitioned large tables	Medium — needs clustering key awareness + partition boundary analysis
Incremental model health monitoring	Low (post-conversion concern)	Low — track row growth rate, late-arriving %, full-refresh frequency for models already converted
Cost impact estimation accuracy	Low — current estimate uses avg_build_time * redundancy_rate	Low — could use QUERY_ATTRIBUTION_HISTORY for exact per-build credits
Downstream freshness impact	Low — converting to incremental can increase data freshness for downstream	Low — could note "downstream models will see data X minutes sooner"
Relationship to Other Domains
Cross-Domain Signal	How It Connects	Current State
Expensive query (same model)	An expensive query that rebuilds a full table → incremental would reduce cost	Detected in cross_domain_insights (signal: incremental + expensive_query)
Spillage (same model)	Full rebuild overflows memory → incremental reduces working set	Detected in cross_domain_insights (signal: spillage + incremental)
Clustering candidate (same table)	Table needs clustering AND incremental → do incremental first (reduces rebuild, makes clustering maintenance cheaper)	Detected in cross_domain_insights hierarchy
View chain (upstream)	A view upstream of this table causes cascading recomputation → materialize the view first	Detected via materialization v2 candidates
Warehouse idle credits	Infrequent but expensive builds keep warehouse alive → incremental reduces build time → warehouse can suspend sooner	Not explicitly linked yet (backlog: expensive query cost growth mapping)
Size Threshold Reference
Variable	Default	Effect
incremental_large_table_row_threshold	10,000,000	Above this: prefer delete+insert over merge (avoids full-target scan)
incremental_large_table_gb_threshold	10 GB	Above this: prefer delete+insert over merge
incremental_unique_key_probe_threshold	0.95	APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT / COUNT(*) must exceed this to confirm a key
incremental_candidates_min_build_time_sec	300 (5 min)	Minimum build duration to trigger candidate consideration
incremental_candidates_min_size_gb	2 GB	Minimum table size to trigger candidate consideration
incremental_candidates_min_compute_waste_score	5	size_gb * builds_per_day minimum
incremental_candidates_min_qualified_build_days	3	Minimum CTAS runs needed to trust redundancy signal
